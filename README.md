# Google Search Form 🔍

This project contains a simple HTML form that lets users perform a Google search directly from the page. This form is a practical and straightforward way to understand the basics of **HTTP GET requests**—a great starting point for anyone new to web development!

> **Note**: This is my favorite way of learning and now teaching HTTP requests, having learned these concepts hands-on.

## Features

- **Search Form**: Users can enter search queries and submit them directly to Google.
- **HTTP GET Request**: This form action demonstrates the use of the HTTP GET request method by sending the query to Google’s search engine.

## How It Works

The form submits the search query via a GET request to Google:
```html
<form action="https://www.google.com/search" method="GET">
    <input type="text" name="q" placeholder="Search Google..." required>
    <button type="submit">Search</button>
</form>
```

When the form is submitted, the query in the input field is appended as a URL parameter and sent to Google’s search engine, which then returns the results.


## Why This Project?

This simple page serves as an effective introduction to HTTP requests, giving learners a practical, hands-on example of how web forms interact with search engines and other services using GET requests.
